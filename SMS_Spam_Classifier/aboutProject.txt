Dataset -  Dataset used is from kaggle - "text spam dataset", imbalanced dataset
models used to train the dataset used are  -  Naive bayes, support vector machine,K-nearest neighbour, Random forest, stacking classifiervoting classifiervoting
deployment - deployment used for this models are streamlit method,flask deployment, AWS EC2 deployment
