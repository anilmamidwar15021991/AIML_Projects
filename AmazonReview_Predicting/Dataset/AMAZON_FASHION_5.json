Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo).

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row.

I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!", "summary": "Great shoe!", "unixReviewTime": 1523750400}

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.", "summary": "Comfortable and lightweight", "unixReviewTime": 1462320000}

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them.

As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way.

I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.", "summary": "Comfortable and lightweight", "unixReviewTime": 1462320000}
