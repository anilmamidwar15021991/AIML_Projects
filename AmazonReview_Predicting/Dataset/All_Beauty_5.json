I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.\n\nThere slogan was \" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN \" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.\n\nThe only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.\n\nAt any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.\n\nNote :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.", "summary": "Truth is There IS Nothing Like an AQUA VELVA MAN.", "unixReviewTime": 1304380800}

The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.\n\nOn opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.\n\nOne of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.\n\nThe price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.\n\nGreat job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.", "summary": "Outstanding Body Wash", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800}

I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.\n\nAs I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy.

The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2016", "summary": "This product makes you love life first thing in the morning.", "unixReviewTime": 1471564800}

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.\n\nOn opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.\n\nOne of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.\n\nThe price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.\n\nGreat job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2013", "summary": "Outstanding Body Wash", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800}

I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.\n\nAs I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy.

The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit.

You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.\nThis model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.\nOther than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.\nThe Waterpik is easy to use and maintain and has  paid for itself many times over since I never buy floss.", "summary": "For Those Who Want To Save What Nature Gave Them", "unixReviewTime": 1338249600}

I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot.

It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.\n\nI agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).\n\nThe water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.\n\nSound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.\n\nThe auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.\n\nIn actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.\n\nGood performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.", "summary": "Clean teeth and fresh breath!", "unixReviewTime": 1176595200}

Second, many people can't afford to go to the dentist for problems like cavities and live with the pain, how will they be able to go get their teeth cleaned from using this product?

I've always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable. After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I've since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco.

He still insists that razor a blade gives a closer shave and I agree, the skin is a lot smoother and clearer but this is great for the weekends when he wants to get rid of the stubble and not scratch my face off. This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!\n\nOverall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work. This makes a great holiday gift, a gadget that people wouldn't run out and buy for themselves necessarily and fun to have as an option in the morning.\n\n- Kasia S.", "summary": "Sleek and modern", "unixReviewTime": 1197936000}

After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.\n\nThere are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.\n\nBut if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.", "summary": "After Three Weeks of Use", "unixReviewTime": 1197590400}

When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.\n\nI think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.\n\nIf I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.", "summary": "End of all irritation", "unixReviewTime": 1197331200}

The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.\n\nOn opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.\n\nOne of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.\n\nThe price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.\n\nGreat job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.", "summary": "Outstanding Body Wash", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800}

If you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.

Just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  Ten minutes later it is done and all those big, bad bacteria are dead... well, 99% of them anyways.\n\nSo, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.

That is why I mentioned in the title that this may be perfect for hypochondriacs while most people will shrug and wonder what the point is.

I have an automatic toothbrush and all I do now is put its head in this neat sanitizer and it kills all the bacteria and I can go on for another 20-30 days without having to worry about repeating this process. The product has UV bulb, which is what actually kills the bacteria.

If you want to look ten years younger, this is the cream to try. I find it helps with elasticity and skin resilience. I also notice I break out less and have overall clearer skin.

The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.\n\nOn opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.\n\nOne of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.\n\nThe price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.\n\nGreat job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.", "summary": "Outstanding Body Wash", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800}

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.\n\nEven though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.\n\nThe first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.\n\nAs for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.\n\nSo 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove. Although I do not use one, it is nice to have an an option just in case. Zero complaints! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.", "summary": "Bought for traveling, but will use daily.", "unixReviewTime": 1468108800}

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.\n\nOn opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.\n\nOne of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.\n\nThe price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.\n\nGreat job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.", "summary": "Outstanding Body Wash", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800}

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.\n\nEven though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.\n\nThe first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.\n\nAs for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.\n\nSo 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.\n\nThis is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.\n\nWhen you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.\n\nIf there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are.

What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.\n\nI poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent.

I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference.

I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.\n\nHere are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:\n\nWater, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).\n\nThis is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the \"peel\" portion time to do its work.\n\nIt also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.\n\nThis has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.\n\nThis may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.\n\nThis is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.\n\nI personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)\n\nI do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results.", "summary": "works very well, maybe not the best for sensitive skin", "unixReviewTime": 1472342400}

Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing.

I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!\n\nTo get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.\n\nI agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).\n\nThe water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.\n\nSound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.\n\nThe auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.\n\nIn actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.\n\nGood performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.", "summary": "Clean teeth and fresh breath!", "unixReviewTime": 1176595200}

Complete with toothpaste, floss and mouthwash, this would be a great gift.\n\nThe toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  I like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  The brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  I like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.\n\nI think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  I also wish it had a setting memory.  Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.\n\nI like it, it works well, there are just a few things I would prefer be different.

There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.\n\nThe charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.\n\nThis model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.\n\nThe brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.\n\nIt is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.\n\nThere is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.\n\nNo complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. An electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.", "summary": "Complete kit with 5000 model toothbrush", "unixReviewTime": 1386115200}

The toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues.. The mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. Toothpaste and floss are full sized. This is a mouth transformation kit. If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.\n\nPreviously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it. Once I tried this Oral B toothbrush, I gave up on my Sonicare. I am 37, I smoke cigarettes, drink A LOT of energy drinks, and have braces. I NEED extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. I would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when I was using the Sonicare.\n\nI love that I can actually feel it working on my gums. It really feels like a gum massage. The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. That is where I feel the extra attention and the gum care. My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one. I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare. It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give. I had been using Sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked. My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. This Oral B fills in the gap and gives me everything I am looking for, and then some. I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B.\n\nThe mouthwash is great for gums. I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.\n\nThe toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.\n\nMainly, I am just super impressed with the toothbrush. I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black) but I much prefer this 5000 version. The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud. The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT. The attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.\n\nIf you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy. You can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products, but for the price, you might as well get the bundle and try out the mouthwash, toothpaste and floss and see how you like them.\n\nI do not intend to go back to Sonicare after having used this Oral B. I NEVER thought I would say that.", "summary": "Amazing cleaning and gum care", "unixReviewTime": 1385942400}

I have found that I only needed to apply the lip stain (or liquid lipstick, or whatever you want to call it) once and it lasted throughout an entire work day.  So they're not lying about the 16 hours (well, I probably wore it for more like 10 or 11 hours, but it still looked good and was a bit difficult to remove at the end of that time).  I applied it using the doefoot applicator it comes with and then kept my lips slightly open while I let it dry.\n\nI gave it a few minutes and did other things to get ready, then applied the balm over it.  The balm has a similar applicator to the lip stain part.  The balm (or you might call it a gloss) is clear.  It did pick up some of the color of the stain on the applicator when I used it, but no big deal since I'm only going to ever use the balm *with* the stain.  Anyway, although the stain itself was rather drying, using the second step made this product completely comfortable to wear.  I did have to reapply the balm a few times throughout the day.\n\nI did not get much color transfer to mugs and I did not lose much color over the course of the day.  I found the appearance of the product quite acceptable at the end of the day.  It was actually a bit difficult to get off; I used a dual phase liquid makeup remover on a cotton pad and I kind of had to scrub.  You may want to finish up with a lip scrub to ensure complete removal.  Anyway, this stuff has staying power.\n\nThe berry color I had was more of a cool red than a true berry color, at least on my lips.  I really liked the color.  I'm pale, but I think it would show up on people with darker skin tones as well.  This was non-irritating and didn't have a noticeable fragrance.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this product.

I had hoped that I would be able to bury my nose in this bar from Pre de Provence and imagine that I had just opened a bottle of patchouli essential oil.  No, no, it did not happen.  While it is a lovely fragrance, it is somewhat meek and mild.  Maybe that is what you are looking for, but I wanted deep, true, powerful patchouli.\n\nWith this bar from Pre de Provence I do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  It was opportune that I had recently purchased two bars of soap from Plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  Oh, my!  Those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  Way more so than those from Pre de Provence.  Having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  The Plantlife dried my skin.  This Pre de Provence always left my skin soft and supple.  It was a BIG difference; so easy to see when I had the two together.\n\nSo, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  True potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  For me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means I go with the Pre de Provence.\n\nIf you do want to try the Plantlife patchouli, this is it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Patchouli-100-Pure-amp-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B000146LKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Patchouli 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.

Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.

It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.  But, interestingly, I noticed something when I traded that bar for the Pre de Provence:  While the Plantlife has the fragrance, Pre de Provence has the moisturizers.  When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.\n\nSo, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.\n\nA word about the size of this 250g bar:  If you have long fingers or large hands, you will be able to grasp this bar easily.

The soap comes wrapped in plastic, but the aroma is unmistakably Patchouli.\n\nTo me, the scent the Patchouli reminds me of \"Dead Heads,\" or followers of the band Grateful Dead.  They made Patchouli oil main stream.  But Patchouli is also good to fight itchy skin, and smells wonderful. It has an unmistakable musky floral aroma.\n\nThis soap is also Shea Butter enriched, which means luxurious softness.  Nothing I've found blends into my skin like Shea Butter, and I have been religiously using Pre de Provence lotions with Shea Butter for a while now.  Their products are high quality and make me feel pampered.  The scents are delicious - I am feeding my soul with these wonderful fragrances.\n\nWhile women will love this Patchouli Shea Butter Enriched soap, it will also be great for a man.  Patchouli is quite masculine.\n\nThis bar of soap is great for putting in your bathtub.  Or keep a bar at the sink to lather up and smell good between showers.

Poza", "reviewText": "This is an average-sized bar of scented French-milled, French-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. I will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic Ivory soap or Kirkland's body bar. This gets extra points for those added qualities.\n\nI will note the price differences first. This is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of Kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. Both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. Besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. The lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. One point about it that I was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that I walked out of the shower smelling as if I'd applied a scent to my skin. This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it, but didn't subject others to it once I was out of the bath. In my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. If you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.\n\nIn terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. I'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. I wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least I still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that I've used.\n\nThe bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. This is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. I had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. I will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). This soap doesn't do that. It dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. That means that it lasts a lot longer. I can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that I got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the Kirkland bars that I usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to Ivory, which I find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent.", "summary": "lasts longer than mass-mproduced consumer soaps, natural scent", "unixReviewTime": 1504828800}

The scent is way too sweet for me, but it doesn't linger long.\n\nThe soap itself is smooth and lathers pretty well. It is very soft, feels nice on the skin and does actually clean you off. I found that I needed to rinse a little more than usual to get the last residue of it off though. (We don't have soft water) I like this, but I am not convinced it's any better than a regular soap for a lot less money.", "summary": "Sweet scent, lathers & cleans fine.

Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.\n\nThe first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.\n\nAs for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.\n\nSo 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus.

I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.\n\nThis is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.\n\nWhen you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.\n\nIf there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them.

I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence.

I would recommend the \"Regular\" Essies if you want to do nail art, but for regular one-color wear, either formula is nice.

They dry quickly once the top coat is on (the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the  top coat is applied), and as they dry they self-level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique (like mine) is imperfect.\n\nThe Gel Couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time, but I use that top coat over other Essies quite often as well.\n\nMy Essie collection is approaching 100 bottles and my obsession shows no signs of abating.

I found it lasted for about as long as any other polish when worn with a good topcoat- about four days.

The result is that I won't be wearing this without base coat again.  The bigger takeaway is that I don't find this to be fundamentally different from other nail polishes.

Perry", "reviewText": "I **LOVE** my Essies.  They are by far my favorite nail polish brand (and one of only two brands I will buy--only others are impossible on my nails).  Even though I have less-than-stellar technique and I am admittedly horribly hard on my nails, with Essie I can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips, redos, or drama. I am loyal to this brand for a reason!\n\nWEAR TIME:  I'm fairly new to the Gel Couture line, though I've worn the classic Essie polishes for much longer.  I wondered how these would compare to my regular Essie routing (which is, Grow Stronger base coat, 2 coats of color, followed by Good to Go top coat), and I was astounded to find they compare very, very favorably.  I swear by Essie base coat, but was impressed that Gel Couture performed equally well with and without it.  (I do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime; with Gel Couture I noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat, though base coat  is a game changer with the classic Essies).  With my classic Essie colors, I tend to get about a week of wear, but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week (my goal is always every other day, but I usually forget pretty often).  In testing these out, I resisted reapplying top coat AT ALL, so that I could get a sense of how they wore on one application.  I'm quite impressed.  I got 11 days of wear, with a small few chips coming of the 11th or 12th day (depending on the shade).  I'm more than satisfied with that, given that I'm ridiculously hard on my nails and don't own a dishwasher.  Also, aside from Essie, I've found (at any price point) that there's only one other brand that doesn't chip within 24 hours (I can usually get 4 or 5 days with Revlon, so it's my second choice).  I went from a week with \"regular\" Essie to almost TWO weeks with these.  These last well past the point where I want to change my polish colors.\n\nCOLOR APPLICATION:  I've tried 7 of these Gala Bolds (as well as some from the original release and all but two of the Ballet Nudes), and I would say that with the exception of ONE shade, all of these polishes are dreamy to work with.  These are slightly thicker, more jelly like consistency than the classic Essies.  They are smooth and self leveling, apply like butter and look as smooth as satin.  The drip-free brush has a fabulous contour, so even working on my small nails, the wider brush was not an issue.  Most shades were opaque in one coat (but I'm a two coat girl, so I went for two anyway).  As Essie herself says, they \"Go on like silk and wear like Iron.\"  The one color with a less stellar experience was \"Wearing Hue\" and if you sort Amazon reviews by color (yup, that's possible) you'll notice that most of the few negative reviews relate to that shade.  It's not an impossible shade, and milky opaque pastel colors are the more \"struggle-some\" colors in any range.  However, I did need a third coat to get to opaque and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed. It still self leveled and wore beautifully.  I'd give this one shade 4 stars, but the others deserve more than 5.\n\n(And anytime you are working with Essie, be patient with your perceived mistakes; give them a moment, they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application wasn't perfect.  They may be magic.)\n\nTOP COAT:  I've taken to using this top coat with regular Essies instead of my Good to Go top coat.  There's magic in this bottle. Instead of getting 6-7 days with classic Essies, I can get more (though, I rarely want to, as I like to change my nail colors.)  With this top coat on Gel Couture, I am seeing 11 days!  Also, though I reapplied the Good to Go throughout the week, I don't feel the need to reapply with this one.  The Good to Go MIGHT stay a little (tiny bit) shinier through the week, but that's a hard call.  Though both wear well, this is my favorite.  Both dry super fast.  Like, ridiculously fast.  (I am currently testing the Gel Setter one, so I can't compare it yet.)  You do need to use this top coat with the Gel Couture polishes (or they won't last), however it's nice that it will work with traditional Essies as well.\n\nI called Essie about this Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat, since I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the Gel Couture Top Coat (which is what it was called in the initial release of this line).  Essie has FABULOUS customer service, and they were able to confirm that it was a rebranding, and Gel Couture Top Coat and Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat are the same thing, just slightly rebranded.  (Not to be confused with the Gel Setter top coat, which IS different, and is NOT the one to use with this line.)\n\nI can never recommend Essie enough.  They changed my nail game.  When I was almost ready to give up because fixing my nails took soooo long to do and to dry and I was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes, I discovered Essie.  They are MAGIC, I tell you.  They dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills, and before I have a chance to screw them up.  And they stay on my impossible nails.  There's nothing remotely as good.

This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look.

I let it dry 3-5 minutes between each color coat and 10 minutes after the top coat.  The results look like what you'd get from a nail salon and lasts the whole week.

The combination of these two is, without a doubt, the best offering essie has ever put out there.\n\nFirst of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.\nAfter doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.\nIf you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.\nIt evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.\n\nAnd here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.\nI have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.\nThe brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.\nThis review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.\nIt looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.\nGetting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.\nIf your experience is as good as mine, this will be the only topcoat you ever use from now on.", "summary": "The.

But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing \"meter\".  What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  You can also get a fifth star (for tongue) if you go a total of 2 1/2 minutes.  For me, that's not a big deal.  But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly.\n\nHe brushes with enthusiasm now, and I've noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  For me, it's a helpful reminder to brush longer than I was used to.  The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.\n\nHowever, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  One, the price point.  I wouldn't pay more than $50 for this set.  In all actuality, it doesn't seem worth the extremely high price point.  I mean, a Crest tote bag?  What am I going to do with that?  I don't think the set warrants the price.\n\nThe other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  Not to mention your face!  My son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  So, it's a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.\n\nIn all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.", "summary": "Excellent set but a steep price!", "unixReviewTime": 1386633600}

It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. \"Smooth\" fits the flavor/strength perfectly. It is not harsh at all, but still effective.\n\nThis mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.\n\nI used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.\n\nI did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36.

It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. \"Smooth\" fits the flavor/strength perfectly. It is not harsh at all, but still effective.\n\nThis mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.\n\nI used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.\n\nI did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36.
